# Netflix Movies & TV Shows – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project is focused only on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of the Netflix dataset.  
I analyzed different features like rating, duration, release year, and genres to understand patterns in the content uploaded on Netflix.

I was not able to complete the machine learning model part yet, so **this repository currently contains only EDA**.  
I plan to continue the project by adding feature engineering and prediction models later.

## 📌 What This Project Includes
- Loading and cleaning the dataset  
- Checking missing values  
- Visualizing ratings, release years, content types  
- Understanding distributions of movie durations  
- Identifying popular genres  
- Looking for trends in Netflix data over the years  

## 📊 Key Findings
Some interesting patterns I noticed:
- Most Netflix content has been added after 2015  
- Movies dominate the dataset compared to TV shows  
- The most common ratings include TV-MA, TV-14, and TV-PG  
- Many movies fall within the 80–120 minute duration range  
- Certain genres appear very frequently (like dramas and comedies)

## 📝 Current Status
- ✔ EDA completed  
- ❌ Model training and prediction **not completed yet**  
- ⏳ Plan to add ML part in the next update (predicting movie type, rating, or duration)

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Google Colab

## 🚀 Future Work
I want to extend this project by adding:
- Feature Engineering  
- Classification/Regression model  
- More visualizations  
- Possibly a small interactive dashboard  

## 🙌 About Me
I’m learning machine learning and data analysis step by step.  
This project helped me understand how to explore a dataset properly before moving into modeling.
